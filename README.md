# Work Log Fit

Work Log Fit is an application primarily designed for Android devices, although it should function on other platforms as well. It assists users in logging their weight training sessions at the gym. When I couldn't find an open-source application that met my requirements, I decided to learn Dart and Flutter to create my own. There is potential for code refinement, but the application remains straightforward in its current form.
